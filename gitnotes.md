## Git Class I

### Class Introduction
> Learn how to leverage the power of git and github to better manage your code and/or your infrastructure configuration. In this fast paced, hands on class you'll learn the basics of git and how to use branching to keep your projects under control. We'll then look at how to share your code on github and collaborate with others most effective via cloning, collaborating, forking and pull requests. If you'd like to go beyond the basics, consider also taking the intermediate and advanced class in the afternoon.





## Git Class II

> Learn how to fix almost anything with amend, reset, revert, rebase and even the magical reflog. Learn about alternative workflows and best practices for collaboration using github and git. Whether you're comfortable with the basics of adding and committing to git, have a little experience with branching and know how to clone a github repo or have a couple of years of solid git experience, by the end of this class you'll understand git more deeply and be able to use it more elegantly. If you're completely new to git, consider taking the foundations class in the morning first so you're ready for this afternoon session.
